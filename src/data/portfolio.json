    "About": {
        "paragraph": "I'm a Full Stack developer with a B.S. degree in Technology Management from UC Davis. Having a solid foundation in data structures and algorithms, front end development and agile software development has helped me to solve complex and challenging problems. As a developer, I always strive to learn new technologies to create efficient and elegant applications. Developing Apps is my passion, and I hope to positively impact people's lives. When I'm not coding, I enjoy working out, playing basketball, listening to music, and reading."
